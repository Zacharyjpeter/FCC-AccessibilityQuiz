A short form that helped me learn accessibility best practices. Click the header to view project.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
This project wasn't particularly challenging. However, anytime I'm learning new elements or web rules, understanding and retaining the knowledge is my biggest concern. There were several terms and standards like ARIA, WC3, and semantic labels I never knew existed.
<br>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
Accessibility is important to a well designed and inclusive website. As someone who currently works in higher ed, inclusivity is something I value. Moving forward I will actively consider screen readers and use semantic hmtl in my sites.
